# OC301_GitHubCheckIns
Repository for students to upload individual GitHub check-ins

# Instructions
Check-ins should be `pushed` to GitHub on every day that there is a lecture. This can be done remotely, as long as you have access to the server. Each GitHub check-in is worth 1\% for a total of 15\%. OC 301 has a total of 19 lectures, so you can miss up to 4 GitHub check-ins without affecting your grade.

## 1. Creating a GitHub account (once; HW0)
After **Lecture 0**, you should have created a GitHub account and the instructor should have added you to your own private version of this folder. 

## 2. Setting up ssh keys (once; HW1)
In **Lecture 1**, you will set up ssh keys on the server to be ready for the GitHub check-ins. Tailored instructions will be provided in HW1.

## 3. Clone your own private version of this repository (once; HW1)
In **Lecture 1**, you will also clone your own version of this repository from GitHub to your home directory on the server. You can then try to attempt the first GitHub check-in.
